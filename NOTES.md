## Challenges
- Some of the setup instructions were deprecated and I had to conduct research to update them. For example, in README.md on line 63 `bun run mcp:inspect` is now 404. After seeing the error was trying to pull anthropics MCP inspector tool in the terminal, I went to anthropic's website and found the updated terminal command and updated the package.json with it.
