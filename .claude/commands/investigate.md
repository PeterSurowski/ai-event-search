Investigate a potential issue in the codebase.

When investigating:
1. First understand the expected behavior from the code and documentation
2. Trace the data flow from input to output
3. Look for edge cases or code paths that might diverge from expected behavior
4. Check if tests adequately cover the scenario
5. Suggest a fix if an issue is found

Use the following approach:
- Read relevant source files
- Check test coverage for the area
- Look for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase
- Consider multi-tenant/authorization implications
